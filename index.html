									<p>Michael, I count myself fortunate to have worked with you since 2012 on the EHT.  Your creativity, incredible drive and <i>ahem</i> dry wit, have helped shape the entire project.  Quite simply, the EHT wouldn't be where it is today without you.  Happy birthday - and many more.</p>

									<p>Michael!  You’ve been a calming and inspiring figure in the astonishing Event Horizon Telescope work already done and still unfolding.  With an always critical eye about ideas and calculations, you have welcomed contributions from all sides;  you have fostered discussion that tests concepts backwards and forward but you never let the discussion come within a country mile of personal dismissal.   You have been welcoming to visiting senior, early career, and student collaborators, and managed, with great good skill,  to help calm waters even in the worst of tempests.  You’ve worked well and quietly to reassure the most senior members of the group—and the most junior, never putting yourself forward at the expense of others.  You are admired and valued as a friend and scientific guidestar in this collaboration, and will be for the long term.  Michael, happy birthday!  All my best, Peter.</p>

									<p>There is nothing I can say about Michael's brilliance or  unparalleled contributions to the EHT that hasn't already been said more eloquently by others. I'll say personally that I feel like I would have gotten no where in grad school without Michael patiently explaining things to me back in the old 160 Concord Ave office when I knew absolutely nothing about VLBI, and continuing to patiently explain things to me these days now that I know very slightly more than nothing. It is an extraordinary privilege to have Michael as a mentor, and it will be <i>devastating</i> when I am no longer in Cambridge and able to plead in person for him to stay  5 minutes past 5 PM to help with just one more thing...
